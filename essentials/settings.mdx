### New-hire needs to change his onboarding slot

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a Slack conversation with Elementum AI's agent">
    Ask the agent to move `username/email` to a new onboarding bootcamp date.

    <Tip>
      If the question is similar to an existing FAQ, the agent will search the knowledge base for the answer.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent will run the workflow">
    If the question is not related to an existing FAQ, the agent will review the availability of the bootcamp roster for the requested date.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent will confirm action or run the workflow until a solution is reached">
    - If the agent finds availability for the requested date, it will ask you to confirm the action to move the new-hire bootcamp slot. 
    - If the agent does not find availability for the requested date, it will ask for permission to check for additional availability. The agent will run the workflow using the rules again and continue to check for availability based on your request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent will automate final interactions">
    Once the agent finds a solution, it will go beyond answering your initial question and operate within the workflow to automate interactions in a business process.
